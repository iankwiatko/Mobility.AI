# Mobility.AI
This was our group project for HACK/IO 2022. Our goal was to build an alert system for a skateboard using artificial intelligence to recognize
people/objects from a given input feed and avoid them. I was responsible for the recoginition portion of the project, which is what this project is. Even though 
I did not manage to finish this during the competition, I am still pursuing it as a personal project.

Am currently working on switching from Amazon Rekognition to OpenCV, which is much more reliable and easily itegrates with Python.
